AWS Data Center - Internal Monitoring System



Not sure if this will be the final plan but we hope to make an internal monitoring system that provides real-time monitoring to track system health and prevent potential issues before they impact operations. This is the initial plan and may be changed in the future depending on the timeline.

  



 How It Works  

1. Data Collection – Gathers information from various pieces of infrastructure like server  

2. Processing & Analysis – Aggregates the data to see if any of them are not behaving like the others (having errors) 

3. Visualization & Reporting – Provides a centralized dashboard for monitoring and decision-making.  

4. Automated Responses – Triggers predefined actions and notify personnel of the problem



 Usages 

- Infrastructure Health Monitoring – Ensures consistent performance and reliability for customers utilizing those servers.  

- Incident Response & Prevention – Reduces downtime by addressing issues proactively which may reduce lost income and trust.  

- Compliance & Audit Support – Maintains detailed records for regulatory and security purposes so that it may be dealt with accordingly.  

 



This monitoring system is essential for maintaining the reliability, security, and efficiency of data center operations, ensuring continuous improvement and adaptability to future needs.
